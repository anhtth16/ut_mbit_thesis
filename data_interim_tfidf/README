This folder contains all interim data relating to TF-IDF feature engineering process:
- TF-IDF models: job_tf.pickle, work_history_tf.pickle
- TF-IDF output vectors: tfidf_matrix.npz (job) and work_history_tf_matrix.npz (work history)
- Training and testing data in vector:
X_train_159, X_test_159, Y_train_159, Y_test_159: these are used for training binary classification model using random ranking data.

This folder contain result and analysis for all research questions.
JRS performance evaluation:
- Analysis_BinaryCls_full.xlsx: Performance metrics of different binary classification models
- Analysis_Hit_rate_full.xlsx: Compare hit_rate across 17 JRS, on different potential data & Data-centric explanation
- Model_Fidelity_Result.xlsx: Compare model fidelity results

Explanation evaluation:
- Global_Explanation.xlsx: Plot feature importance for self-explanation models: LogReg, DT, XGBoost

For local explanation (SHAP, LIME), the magnitude, i.e. the absolute value of the feature importance weights or Shapley values was used for comparison 
- LIME_Analysis_sample20.xlsx: Compare local explanation by LIME on different JRS. Compute feature importance fidelity
- SHAP_Analysis_sample20.xlsx: Compare local explanation by LIME on different JRS. Compute feature importance fidelity
